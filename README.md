# PoE-Auto-Flasks
## Setup:
- Run PoE-Auto-Flasks.ahk
- With your inventory closed, click "Load flasks"
- Close the prompt and click your flasks as instructed
  - The mouse will move and copy your flask information
- If you have multiple flasks with similar effects, tick the box under 'Shared CD'
  - If you have row 1, CD 2 and 3 selected, your flask rotation will be 1,2,3,1,2,3,...


## Things to note:
  - Jitter is used to introduce randomness, feel free to change it to your needs
  - Default hotkey to toggle the script is [shift]+[space]. You can change this by editing line 16 of the .ahk script to suite your needs.
  - The values do not currently look at modifiers for "increased flask duration", but a field for that will be added at a later point in time.
- Minimize the window when setup is complete. Closing with the 'x' will close the script.

## Known issues
  - Sometimes pressing the hotkey doesn't toggle the macro successfully. This usually happens when the macro is pressing a button but I don't have a fix for this at this point in time.
